# Browser Extension

The browser extension sends allowlisted site content snapshots to the local
WebLayer daemon and applies the daemon's returned DOM commands. Chrome and
Firefox use the same shared source with browser-specific manifests.

## Build Development Extensions

```sh
make -C browser-extension
```

This creates `browser-extension/dist/chrome` and
`browser-extension/dist/firefox`.

## Load in Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable Developer mode.
3. Choose **Load unpacked**.
4. Select `browser-extension/dist/chrome`.

## Load in Firefox

1. Open `about:debugging`.
2. Choose **This Firefox**.
3. Choose **Load Temporary Add-on**.
4. Select `browser-extension/dist/firefox/manifest.json`.

## Daemon Contract

The extension captures content only through explicit site adapters. Unknown
hosts, unknown page surfaces, and unknown DOM structures send nothing. The
current adapter supports X.com and Twitter URLs for home, explore, search, and
status pages, and it captures visible top-level `article[data-testid="tweet"]`
post regions. X snapshots include observed post metadata such as post ID,
author handle, visible order, and `Replying to @...` handles so the daemon can
build the visible reply tree and decide any hide cascade. Quoted posts stay
inside the captured post snapshot; nested quoted-post cards are not targeted as
separate feedback regions.

The extension opens a WebSocket to:

```http
GET ws://127.0.0.1:17891/v1/events
```

It sends DOM analysis events and receives command events. The daemon can push
immediate `pending` commands, such as `insertFeedbackControl`, before local
analysis finishes. When a final answer is already cached, the daemon can push
`final` immediately without a `pending` event.

The REST endpoint remains available as a fallback and smoke-test path:

```http
POST http://127.0.0.1:17891/v1/dom/analyze
Content-Type: application/json
```

The extension also sends user feedback to the daemon:

```http
POST http://127.0.0.1:17891/v1/dom/feedback
Content-Type: application/json
```

Supported DOM command actions are `keep`, `hide`, `dim`, `insertLabel`,
`insertFeedbackControl`, `replaceText`, and `showDebugStats`. On X pages the
daemon emits `showDebugStats` in ordinary command responses. The extension
renders that payload in the right sidebar when the sidebar is available, with a
link to the local daemon dashboard.

The extension decides only which site content surfaces may be captured. It does
not make filtering decisions. The daemon interprets captured content and
decides what commands to return.
