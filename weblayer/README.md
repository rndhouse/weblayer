# WebLayer

WebLayer is a local web filtering daemon and CLI for user-controlled browsing
rules. It stores encountered site content locally, records feedback, manages
explicit filtering rules, and exposes a REST/WebSocket API for browser clients.
Current site-specific behavior focuses on X/Twitter posts.

## Install

Install from crates.io:

```sh
cargo install weblayer
```

This installs the `weblayer` command. It can run the local daemon or act as a
client for a daemon that is already running.

## Run the Daemon

```sh
weblayer daemon
```

The daemon binds to `127.0.0.1:17891` by default. Override it with:

```sh
WEBLAYER_BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1:19000 weblayer daemon
```

Daemon output uses structured logs on stdout. The default log level is `debug`;
override it with `RUST_LOG`.

Incoming posts are not logged by default. To enable captured-content log events:

```sh
WEBLAYER_LOG_CAPTURED_CONTENT=1 weblayer daemon
```

## CLI

Without `daemon`, `weblayer` talks to a running local daemon. `weblayer` with no
subcommand behaves like `weblayer status`.

```sh
weblayer status
weblayer rules list --site x.com
weblayer rules show x-engagement-bait-reaction --site x.com
weblayer rules create \
  --site x.com \
  --id x-ai-slop \
  --title "AI slop" \
  --instruction "Hide generic AI engagement bait." \
  --positive-example "I asked ChatGPT to write this viral thread"
weblayer rules validate x-engagement-bait-reaction --site x.com
weblayer rules propose --site x.com --min-feedback 2
weblayer rules proposals --site x.com
weblayer rules suggest --site x.com --min-feedback 2
weblayer rules enable x-ai-slop --site x.com
weblayer rules disable x-ai-slop --site x.com
weblayer content list --site x.com --limit 20
weblayer content search --site x.com codex
weblayer content stats --site x.com
weblayer feedback list --site x.com
weblayer annotations list --site x.com --storage-key x:id:123
weblayer annotations put \
  --site x.com \
  --storage-key x:id:123 \
  --annotation-type tag \
  --key topics \
  --value '["local-ai","tools"]' \
  --source agent:organizer
```

Client commands use `http://127.0.0.1:17891` by default. Override that with
`--daemon-origin` or `WEBLAYER_DAEMON_ORIGIN`.

## Local Data

Encountered site content is stored in per-site SQLite databases under the
WebLayer data directory. X posts are stored at:

```text
~/.local/share/weblayer/x.com/db.sqlite
```

X feedback is stored in the same database as both an append-only event log and
current feedback state. A stored active thumbs-down makes later scans hide that
post by X status ID.

Override the root data directory with `WEBLAYER_DATA_DIR`. The daemon uses
bundled SQLite through Rust dependencies, so no separate SQLite service or
system install is required.

Reset the X database on startup with:

```sh
WEBLAYER_X_RESET_DB=1 weblayer daemon
```

This removes `db.sqlite`, `db.sqlite-wal`, and `db.sqlite-shm` for `x.com`
before the daemon opens storage.

## Analysis

Codex app-server analysis is enabled by default. The daemon starts a local
Codex app-server process when needed, keeps one app-server thread alive across
requests, and asks it to evaluate captured X/Twitter posts against active
content rules. Captured X posts with text or a URL are sent to Codex unless the
author has been seen before and has no active feedback on stored posts; unknown
authors and authors with active feedback are still sent for review.

Post opinions and rule proposal generation have separate Codex model, reasoning
effort, and timeout settings. Post opinions default to `gpt-5.4-mini` with
`low` effort. Rule proposals default to `gpt-5.4-mini` with `medium` effort.

Opinions are cached in memory by X status ID, a normalized fallback key, and the
active rule set. This lets the timeline view and single-post view reuse the same
AI decision when they capture the same post content under the same policy.

Post evaluation and rule curation both send at most 20 active rules to Codex.
Rule curation uses at most 10 unprocessed feedback rows per proposal. The daemon
automatically creates a pending rule-set proposal when 10 active feedback rows
are queued, or when at least one queued feedback row exists and 20 more post
encounters have been stored since the last curation run.

Cache hits and X posts sent to the Codex app-server are logged at debug level
on stdout. Repeated full captured post payloads from DOM extraction are logged
at trace level.

## Codex E2E Tests

Codex-backed rule proposal tests are ignored by default because they start the
daemon, call the local Codex app-server, and write review artifacts. Run the
small curated fixture test with:

```sh
WEBLAYER_RUN_CODEX_E2E=1 \
  cargo test --test codex_rule_proposals \
  codex_rule_proposal_from_curated_feedback -- --ignored --nocapture
```

To run against a temporary copy of local WebLayer data:

```sh
WEBLAYER_RUN_CODEX_E2E=1 WEBLAYER_E2E_USE_LOCAL_DATA=1 \
  cargo test --test codex_rule_proposals \
  codex_rule_proposal_from_local_data_copy -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Both tests use temporary databases and do not apply proposals. Artifacts are
written to `target/codex-e2e/` unless `WEBLAYER_E2E_ARTIFACT_DIR` is set.

`/v1/events` is the primary extension path. The extension opens a WebSocket,
sends DOM analysis events, receives immediate `pending` commands that gate
identified posts, then receives `final` commands after local analysis finishes.

`/v1/dom/analyze` is the REST smoke-test path. It accepts the same DOM snapshot
shape and returns final DOM commands in one response. `/v1/dom/feedback`
records `thumbsDown`, `undoThumbsDown`, and `updateReason` signals for one DOM
region. Feedback controls include an opaque `feedbackContextId`; the extension
echoes that ID back, and the daemon resolves it to the stored rule context that
was in play. Site-scoped inspection endpoints keep the path generic and take
the site scope through the `site` query parameter. `/v1/content` lists recent
stored content or searches it with SQLite FTS5 when `q` is provided.
`/v1/content/stats` returns unique stored content rows and total captured
encounters for the selected site. `/v1/feedback` lists stored user feedback
signals, such as active thumbs-down feedback for X posts.
`/v1/content/annotations` lets agents attach tags, notes, topics, or other JSON
metadata to stored content without changing the original captured content.
`/v1/rules` manages site-scoped filtering rules. New rules default to `draft`;
only `active` rules are sent to the AI analyzer. Rule status values are
`draft`, `active`, `disabled`, and `archived`.
`/v1/rules/{id}/catches` lists recent hidden posts where that rule matched the
final decision, which powers rule evidence in the dashboard.
`/v1/rule-proposals` generates and stores reviewable rule-set change proposals
from active feedback. Proposal generation sends active feedback, current active
rules, feedback-time rule snapshots, and simple per-rule match/hide counts to
the Codex app agent when available. If the agent is unavailable, the daemon
stores a heuristic proposal derived from feedback reasons so the review
pipeline remains testable.

Rule create request shape:

```json
{
  "title": "AI slop",
  "instruction": "Hide generic AI engagement bait.",
  "source": "user",
  "examples": {
    "positive": ["I asked ChatGPT to write this viral thread"],
    "negative": ["Detailed notes about local AI implementation"]
  }
}
```

Rule update requests accept any subset of `title`, `instruction`, `status`,
`priority`, `source`, and `examples`. Example arrays replace only the side
provided. Rule status changes can also use:

```json
{
  "status": "active",
  "source": "user"
}
```

Rule validation uses local stored X posts and reports likely matches from rule
terms and examples. It is a pre-activation blast-radius check, not an AI
classification pass.

Rule suggestions derive draft candidates from active feedback reasons:

```http
GET /v1/rule-suggestions?site=x.com&minFeedback=2&limit=20
```

Suggestions are not stored and are never active automatically. Use their title,
instruction, and examples to create an explicit draft rule after review.

Rule proposals derive reviewable rule-set changes from active feedback:

```http
POST /v1/rule-proposals?site=x.com
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "minFeedback": 2,
  "feedbackLimit": 10
}
```

The response stores and returns a proposal with actions such as `createRule`,
`updateRule`, `disableRule`, or `noChange`. Proposals are not applied
automatically; review them through `/dashboard/proposals/{id}` or
`GET /v1/rule-proposals/{id}`. To manually accept or reject one, post
`{"action":"apply"}` or `{"action":"dismiss"}` to
`/v1/rule-proposals/{id}/decision?site=x.com`.

Content annotation request shape:

```json
{
  "storageKey": "x:id:123",
  "contentKind": "post",
  "annotationType": "tag",
  "key": "topics",
  "value": ["local-ai", "tools"],
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "source": "agent:organizer"
}
```

DOM analysis request shape:

```json
{
  "page": {
    "url": "https://x.com/home",
    "title": "X",
    "capturedAt": "2026-05-22T10:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "elements": [
    {
      "clientId": "dom:1",
      "selector": "article:nth-of-type(1)",
      "tagName": "article",
      "role": "article",
      "text": "Post text",
      "html": "<article>...</article>",
      "attributes": [{ "name": "data-testid", "value": "tweet" }],
      "links": [
        {
          "href": "https://x.com/user/status/123",
          "text": "status",
          "ariaLabel": null
        }
      ],
      "snapshotHash": "abc123",
      "capturedAt": "2026-05-22T10:00:00.000Z",
      "metadata": {
        "xCom": {
          "postId": "123",
          "authorHandle": "@user",
          "postText": "Post text",
          "visibleIndex": 0,
          "replyingToHandles": []
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

DOM analysis response shape:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "action": "insertLabel",
      "target": {
        "clientId": "dom:1",
        "selector": "article:nth-of-type(1)",
        "mustMatchSnapshotHash": "abc123"
      },
      "label": "Summary: Post summary",
      "text": null,
      "reason": "Codex app-server summary",
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "matchedRuleIds": []
    }
  ]
}
```

`insertFeedbackControl` commands include `feedbackContextId`, an opaque
daemon-side lookup key for active rule snapshots and item-specific decision
metadata.

When `WEBLAYER_X_DEBUG_STATS=1`, X/Twitter command responses also include a
`showDebugStats` command. The command carries a `debugStats` payload with
daemon-side storage, feedback, rule curation, and rule-catch counters for a
debug sidebar section. The sidebar links to `/dashboard`, a local daemon page
that summarizes X content stats, active rules, active feedback, and recent
rule proposals.

WebSocket request shape:

```json
{
  "type": "analyzeDom",
  "requestId": "dom:1",
  "page": {
    "url": "https://x.com/home",
    "title": "X",
    "capturedAt": "2026-05-22T10:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "elements": []
}
```

WebSocket command event shape:

```json
{
  "type": "commands",
  "requestId": "dom:1",
  "phase": "pending",
  "commands": []
}
```

Supported command actions are `keep`, `hide`, `dim`, `insertLabel`,
`insertFeedbackControl`, `replaceText`, and `showDebugStats`. Site-specific DOM
interpretation lives under `src/sites/`, and site-specific SQLite storage lives
under `src/storage/`; the extension stays generic and only captures DOM regions
and executes commands.
