# WebLayer

Browser extension that sends allowlisted site content snapshots to a
local WebLayer daemon and applies the daemon's returned DOM commands.

## Build Development Extensions

```sh
make
```

This creates `dist/chrome` and `dist/firefox` from the shared extension source
and the browser-specific manifests.

## Load in Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable Developer mode.
3. Choose Load unpacked.
4. Select `dist/chrome` from this directory.

## Load in Firefox

1. Open `about:debugging`.
2. Choose This Firefox.
3. Choose Load Temporary Add-on.
4. Select `dist/firefox/manifest.json` from this directory.

## Source Layout

- `shared/`: source files used by Chrome and Firefox.
- `chrome/`: Chrome-specific manifest.
- `firefox/`: Firefox-specific manifest.
- `dist/`: generated output; do not edit by hand.

## Daemon Contract

The extension captures content only through explicit site adapters. Unknown
hosts, unknown page surfaces, and unknown DOM structures send nothing. The
current adapter supports X.com and Twitter URLs for home, explore, search, and
status-thread pages, and it captures visible top-level
`article[data-testid="tweet"]` post regions. Quoted posts and reply/thread
context stay inside the captured post snapshot; nested quoted-post cards are
not targeted as separate feedback regions.

The extension opens a WebSocket to:

```http
GET ws://127.0.0.1:17891/v1/events
```

It sends DOM analysis events and receives command events. The daemon can push
immediate `pending` commands, such as `insertFeedbackControl`, before local
analysis finishes. When a final answer is already cached, the daemon can push
`final` immediately without a `pending` event.

The REST endpoint remains available as a fallback and smoke-test path:

```http
POST http://127.0.0.1:17891/v1/dom/analyze
Content-Type: application/json
```

The extension also sends user feedback to the daemon. A thumbs-down click posts
the current region snapshot and the opaque `feedbackContextId` from the
feedback control to:

```http
POST http://127.0.0.1:17891/v1/dom/feedback
Content-Type: application/json
```

For X posts, the daemon stores feedback events and current feedback state in the
X site database. The first thumbs-down records the dislike and opens a local
reason panel; later scans hide posts whose stored feedback state is active.

WebSocket request shape:

```json
{
  "type": "analyzeDom",
  "requestId": "dom:1",
  "page": {
    "url": "https://x.com/home",
    "title": "X",
    "capturedAt": "2026-05-22T10:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "elements": [
    {
      "clientId": "dom:1",
      "selector": "article:nth-of-type(1)",
      "tagName": "article",
      "role": "article",
      "text": "Post text",
      "html": "<article>...</article>",
      "attributes": [],
      "links": [
        {
          "href": "https://x.com/user/status/123",
          "text": "status",
          "ariaLabel": null
        }
      ],
      "snapshotHash": "abc123",
      "capturedAt": "2026-05-21T10:00:00.000Z",
      "metadata": {
        "xCom": {
          "postId": "123",
          "authorHandle": "@user",
          "postText": "Post text"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

WebSocket command event shape:

```json
{
  "type": "commands",
  "requestId": "dom:1",
  "phase": "final",
  "commands": [
    {
      "action": "insertFeedbackControl",
      "target": {
        "clientId": "dom:1",
        "selector": "article:nth-of-type(1)",
        "mustMatchSnapshotHash": "abc123"
      },
      "label": "Hide this post",
      "text": null,
      "reason": "User feedback control",
      "confidence": null,
      "feedbackContextId": "xfctx-0123456789abcdef"
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported actions are `keep`, `hide`, `dim`, `insertLabel`,
`insertFeedbackControl`, `replaceText`, and `showDebugStats`. `showDebugStats`
is emitted only when the daemon enables X debug stats and carries a structured
`debugStats` payload for a small X sidebar section, falling back to a page
overlay when no sidebar is available. The section links to the local daemon
dashboard. The extension decides only which site content surfaces may be
captured. It does not make filtering decisions; the daemon interprets captured
content and decides what commands to return.

Feedback request shape:

```json
{
  "feedback": "thumbsDown",
  "reason": "",
  "page": {
    "url": "https://x.com/home",
    "title": "X",
    "capturedAt": "2026-05-22T10:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "element": {
    "clientId": "dom:1",
    "selector": "article:nth-of-type(1)",
    "tagName": "article",
    "role": "article",
    "text": "Post text",
    "html": "<article>...</article>",
    "attributes": [],
    "links": [
      {
        "href": "https://x.com/user/status/123",
        "text": "status",
        "ariaLabel": null
      }
    ],
    "snapshotHash": "abc123",
    "capturedAt": "2026-05-21T10:00:00.000Z",
    "metadata": {
      "xCom": {
        "postId": "123",
        "authorHandle": "@user",
        "postText": "Post text"
      }
    }
  },
  "feedbackContextId": "xfctx-0123456789abcdef"
}
```

Supported feedback values are `thumbsDown`, `undoThumbsDown`, and
`updateReason`.
